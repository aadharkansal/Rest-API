This web app is a student mark sheet manager made using the Django Rest framework as a backend service, React for the front end, and Axios package for HTTP calls. It is using MySql as a database and has CRUD operations.
In the frontend, it has a leaderboard that shows students in descending order of total marks. Also, it has a search box that accepts Roll no as a search keyword and shows the searched student's details in the table underneath.
In the backend, API endpoints are there when called returns the JSON format response, which gets rendered.
Both the apps are independent of each other because of the use of the REST API concept.
